These are the main techniques I introduced in the thesis:
1. Financial time series (ARMA and GARCH); Varying coefficients models
2. Nonparametric alternatives: Local linear regression, Wavelets 
3. Results processing: Window smoothing, Kernel smoothing

This repo contains eight files.

* `display.rmd` is the display and shortened version of my thesis;
* `display.dpf` is generated by `display.rmd`;
* `stock_data.csv` is the data I used in the thesis.
